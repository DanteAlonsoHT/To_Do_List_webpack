# To Do list: CRUD Interactive List JS.

For this repository, I've created an interactive list to create, read, update, and delete tasks to make a complete To-Do List. I've included front-end technologies in order to create this application, I used JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, and also, I've included Local Storage to handle the data inside this application.

I've been using Webpack to manage the files for the front-end, using loaders for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, in order to fix some special thing at the moment to use the front-end in a server. Feel free to suggest more additional features for this repository, or if you want to use it, feel free to do that as well.
