# To Do list: Interactive List

For this repository, I've created the structure for the List using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, but also I've added Local Storage as the local database to save your tasks in you local browser.

I've been using Webpack to manage the files for front-end, using loaders for HTML, CSS and JavaScript files, in order to fix some special thing at the moment to use the front-end in a server. Feel free to suggest more aditional features for this repository, or if you want to use it, feel free to do that as well.
